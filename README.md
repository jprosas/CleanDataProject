# CleanDataProject

This repository is composed by a single R function (run_analysis.R) which access data for the proyect on a local folder in the following location:

"./UCI HAR Dataset"

The function does not receive any input and returns NULL but creates a clean dataset file named "outputDataset.txt" which is locally saved in the aforementioned location.

The explanation for variable names and function transformations is explained and the CodeBook.md file; nonetheless the function file is also thoroughly commented
